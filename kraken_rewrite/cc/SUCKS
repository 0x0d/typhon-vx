  * only one burst in parallel is supported
  * only one GPU is supported
  * there is no code indentation
  * race conditions are avoided by sleep() :-P
  * TCP interface is somehow magic
  * block fetcher uses plain seeks instead of faster kernel-mode NCQ (~20x perf. in seeking)
  * CL kernel is not bitsliced (~20x perf. in computation)
  * CL blob compression is not supported (~5x perf. in computation)
  * only single-user session is supported
  * kicking fragments is not supported (~5x perf. in real-time cracking)
  * CL streaming is not supported (~2x perf. in computation)
  * .idx file format is inefficient (~2x perf. in loading)
  * efficient protocol should be used (~10x bandwidth)
  * index granularity is hardcoded at 4KiB, 1KiB should be better (investigate)
